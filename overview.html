					<p align="left"><font face="arial" size="-1">The Online Management System (OMS) is an online application that supports the operational aspects of the University's environment, health and safety (EHS) management system. It does this by automatically generating templates for various stages of the planning cycle: PLAN, SERVICE AGREEMENT, IMPLEMENTATION, SELF-ASSESSMENT and AUDIT.</font></p>

					<p align="left"><font face="arial" size="-1"><b>EHS PLANS</b><br>
					The UTS EHS Management System requires all faculties and units to establish and maintain a current EHS Plan. This is an operational plan that focuses on practical procedures to assist in compliance with our EHS obligations.
					<br><br>
					An OMS electronic template is used to assist develop and draft your EHS Plan at a Planning Workshop facilitated by the EHS Branch.
					<br><br>
					Each plan is created in such a way to allow scope for each faculty and unit to determine what procedures best suit their circumstances and the specific hazards relevant to their work environment as well as their courses and research, rather than imposing a "one-size fits all" manual of procedures.
					<br><br>
					The EHS Branch monitors and audits implementation of these plans and reports on implementation and compliance against the plans.</font></p>

					<hr>

					<p align="left"><font face="arial" size="-1"><b>SERVICE AGREEMENT</b><br>
					At the Planning Workshop, a Service Agreement is also negotiated with the EHS Branch. The aim of the Service Agreement is to provide each faculty or unit with the specific resources and support they consider useful to improve compliance. It outlines the services that the EHS Branch will provide to the faculty or unit to assist in the implementation of procedures developed in the plan. 
					<br><br>
					These services are recorded in an OMS electronic template for the purpose of tracking implementation progress.
					</font></p>

					<hr>

					<p align="left"><font face="arial" size="-1"><b>COMPLIANCE ASSESSMENTS</b><br>
					At the midpoint of the plan duration, the Dean or Director undertakes a self-assessment of compliance of the whole faculty or unit against the requirements of their EHS Plan. This involves giving a numerical rating against each item in the plan for that point in time.
					<br><br>
					These ratings are recorded in the OMS to act as a guide to how the faculty/unit estimates it is going and gives an opportunity to note any areas that require attention.</font></p>

					<hr>

					<p align="left"><font face="arial" size="-1"><b>AUDIT</b><br>
					This section contains auditing templates with audit criteria derived from each faculty or unit EHS Plan. The EHS Branch conducts regular audits of high-risk facilities within faculties and units using these audit criteria. Faculties and units can also use these to self-audit their own level of compliance against their EHS Plan.
					<br><br>
					Audit results are recorded in the OMS and reports generated by the OMS are provided to the faculty/unit to facilitate continual improvement of EHS management.
