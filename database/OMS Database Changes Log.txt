Amendments to the ehs.mdb file
------------------------------

20 July 2006
CL made the following changes:

In the table named AD_Departments:
1) Renamed "International Office" to "UTS International", as advised by David Laws.
2) Renamed "ELSSA" to "ELSSA Centre"
3) Renamed "Faculty of Humanities & Social Sciences" to "Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences", in keeping with that area's naming convention.
4) Renamed "Executive Group" to "UTS Executive Group", for consistency
5) Renamed "Access UTS" to blank, removing it from the system. Access UTS is a separate entity to the University.
6) Renamed "UTS Union" to blank, removing it from the system. The UTS Union is a separate entity to the University.

In the table named Ad_Users
1) Renamed the view, edit and create logins for UTS International (formerly the International Office) from "io" to "international".

The OMS was tested following these changes and was found to be working correctly.
