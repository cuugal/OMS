- Corrected formatting of the audit worksheet

4 Aug 2006 - [CL]
Amended all references in .asp files in the OMS where the term "Compliance Checking" was used, to become "Compliance Assessment".

4 September 2006 - [CL]
Made two amendments to the ServiceAgreementReportNA.asp file.

i) Changed an old "EHS Action Plan" reference to "EHS Plan".

OLD:
The purpose of this EHS Service Agreement is to document the services the <%=rsAP("dpName")%> requires from the EHS Branch to assist in the implementation of the EHS Action Plan.

NEW:
This Service Agreement documents the services required from the Environment, Health and Safety Branch by the <%=rsAP("dpName")%> to assist in the implementation of its EHS Plan.

ii) Changed the following line, which referred only to Faculties:

OLD:
<li>Updating the Faculty EHS Plan every <%=rsAP("dpActionPlanDuration")%> years (next one in <%=year(rsAP("apCompletionDate")) + rsAP("dpActionPlanDuration")%>)</li>

NEW:
<li>Updating the EHS Plan every <%=rsAP("dpActionPlanDuration")%> years (next one in <%=year(rsAP("apCompletionDate")) + rsAP("dpActionPlanDuration")%>)</li>


24 October 2006
1. Updated formatting of the audit report (AuditReport.asp)

[C.Lee]

25 January 2007
Updated the introductory text in the index.asp file for the OMS front page with content as supplied by DLJ.
[C.Lee]

29 March 2007
Shrunk the EHS Branch logo graphic used on:
the front page (index.asp)
the header menu (includes/header_menu.asp)
ActionPlanFormA.asp
ActionPlanFormB.asp
ActionPlanReport.asp
AuditForm.asp

ComplianceForm.asp

8 May 2007

Also added the rating scale explanation to the ReportingByFaculty.asp file.
[C.Lee]


7 June 2007
i) Created a new ServiceAgreementStatus.asp file that allows for the comments on the service agreement items to be presented within the comments field directly, and not within a <TEXTAREA> input field. This enables all of the comments to be correctly displayed for printing and taking to a EHS Compliance Assessment meeting. It's a bit of a kludge, as you first have to generate a standard service agreement report from the "super" log-in i.e.
http://www.oms.uts.edu.au/ServiceAgreementReport_new.asp?apID=349&saID=172
and then copy and paste the code i.e.
http://www.oms.uts.edu.au/ServiceAgreementStatus.asp?apID=349&saID=172
I will add a button to the main menu for a supervisor login (in menu.asp) to enable this function to be more easily accessed shortly. [C.Lee]

ii) Edited Menu.asp so that it allows for the ServiceAgreementStatus.asp file to be linked when SUPER user logs in.

8 June 2007
Edited index.asp to include references where Faculties/Units have been merged/amalgamated i.e. IWERM into the Faculty of Science etc. in the Login-ID table at the bottom of the index.asp page.

15 June 2007
OBSERVATION: Elements such as 'high risk hazard programs' are in a different order in body of plan and audit documents to the summary of results. One order is based on chronological sequence of development, the other is based on the 'Display order' field in the DB. Should these be matched up?
OBSERVATION: Audit results printed from IE gives a incorrect alignment of compliance ratings when printed out. This is due to Hazardous substances/dangerous goods going over a line, while the compliance ratings do not. From this point on there is an incorrect alignment in the printed document. We need to fix this.

16 October 2007
For ActionPlanFormA.asp, amended the travel section to read "overnight domestic travel".
For IN_Procedures table within ehs.mdb, amended references from:
"Escape from UTS" video 

to read:
"Escape from UTS" emergency evacuation video

ii) Changed the corresponding audit text for the cash handling change specified in i) above.  Change the ipDefaultAuditText (under IN_Procedures) for cash handling that read:
